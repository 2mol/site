## Projects and toys

- [Trippy](https://trippy.netlify.com) --- a (work-in-progress) travel planner. The aim is to make it very simple to sketch out a high-level plan of a trip. Not the final name.
- [Paperboy](https://github.com/2mol/pboy) --- a command-line utility to get some order into that garbage pile of .pdfs that you keep downloading.
- [solar-system](https://2mol.github.io/solar-system/) --- an interactive toy written in Elm, visualizing how the Euler method for solving a 2-body gravity problem is not great for conservation of energy.
- [Unterhaltsrechner](https://2mol.gitlab.io/urechner/) --- a prototype tool for divorce lawyers to calculate how much spouse & child support their clients have to pay under Swiss law.
